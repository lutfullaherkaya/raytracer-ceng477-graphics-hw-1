/**
 * How I implemented this? - LÃ¼tfullah Erkaya
 * At first I tried implementing a KD tree but it didn't work. I was dividing the space with points and not triangles.
 * Then I thought dividing the triangles, not points was simpler. Only thing I had to do was dividing the triangles list
 * into two and then recursively do the same thing for the two lists. I also had to calculate the bounding box of the
 * triangles list. Then the tree was formed. I thought it was still a KD tree but it was BVH.
 *
 * For dividing in half, at first i sorted the list and divided by median but it was very slow, it was taking 4 seconds
 * to build the tree for horse_and_mug. Then I read in course book that it was faster to not sort but just partition using
 * the middle point of the parent box.
 * Time it took to plant went from 4 seconds to 0,08 seconds.
 *
 * Then I did the divide by widest axis and first box intersection traversal, the rendering became much faster.
